// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, that involves gathering maximum information fromthe client requirements for the product. Discuss each detail and specification of the product with the customer. The development team will analyze the requirements keeping the design and code of the software in mind. This is followed by investigating the validity and possiblity of incorporating these requirements into the software system. The main goal of this stage is that everyone understands even the minute detail of the requirement. Operating systems, security, hardware, and programming are just a few of these requirements."
const design = 'This is the 3rd step, where the program developer scrutinizes whether the preparedness software suffices all of the requirements of the end-user. Additionally, if the project is feasible for the customer technologically, financially, and practically. Once the developer decides on the best design approach, he then selects the program languages such as Oracle, Java, JavaScript, etc, that will suit the software. Once the design specification is prepared, all the stakeholders will review thjis plan and provide their feedback and suggestions. It is crucial to collect and incorporate stakeholders input in the document, because a small mistake can lead to cost overrun.'
const implementation = 'This is the 4th step, where the coding begins. This means translating the design to a computer-legible language. In this stage, the tasks are dividied into units or modules and assigned to various developers. The developers will then begin building the entire system by writing code using the programming languages they chose. This stage is considered to be one of the longest in SDLC. The developers need certain predefined coding guidelines, as well as programming tools like interpreters, compilers, debugger to implement the code. The developers can show the work done to the business analysts in case if any modifications or enhancements required.'
const testingAndIntegration = 'These next steps are the 5th and 6th steps inthe SDLC. Once the developers build the software, it is then deployed in the testing environment. Then the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system. In this phase the testing is done in order toensure that the entire application works according to the customer requirements. After testing, the QA testing team might find some defects or bugs and communicate the same with the developers. The development team then fixes the bugs and send it to QA for a retest. This process continues until the software is stable, bug-free and working according tothe business requirements of that system. At the sixthphase of SDLC, which is deployment, once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use. The size of the project determines the complexity of the deployment. The users are then provided with the training or documentation that will help them to operate the software. Again, a small round of testing is performed on production to ensure environmental issues or any impact of the new release.'
const maintain = 'The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those needs to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of. According to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely.'
